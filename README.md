## Flask blog app

This is a flask blog app based on [this wonderful playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) by [Corey Shafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5).

I plan to watch the vidoes, create user stories and then try to code it on my own. 

### User Stories
- [x] I have a homepage which displays the posts, authors, date of when it was posted.
- [x] I have an access bar which has shortcuts.
- [x] I have a responsive layout which adapts to my screen size.
- [x] I can create my account using my email id.
- [x] I can login using my email id with my password.
- [x] Once I login, I get a success (or failure message) before redirecting to homepage (or staying on the same page)
- [x] While logging in, if I fail to login, I see which field I entered wrong.
- [ ] I can upload my display picture and have a default picture until I upload mine.
- [ ] I can re-login and persist the data.
